        "Random sampling is a statistical technique used to select a subset of individuals, events, or observations from a larger population in a way that every member has an equal chance of being selected. This process plays a critical role in making accurate and unbiased inferences about a population. Below are the key aspects of its role:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Representativeness\n",
        "Random sampling ensures that the sample is representative of the population:\n",
        "\n",
        "It minimizes selection bias, where certain groups may be overrepresented or underrepresented.\n",
        "A representative sample allows inferences drawn from the sample to reflect the characteristics of the entire population.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "If you want to understand the average income in a city, a random sample of households ensures that various income levels are fairly represented.\n",

        "By using random sampling, researchers can generalize findings from the sample to the population:\n",

        "This generalization assumes the sample accurately reflects the population's diversity and key characteristics.\n",
        "It is a foundation of inferential statistics.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Election polls use random sampling to predict voting behavior for the entire electorate.\n",

        "3. Avoidance of Bias\n",
        "Random sampling reduces the risk of bias:\n",
        "\n",
        "Systematic selection of individuals (e.g., only choosing people from a specific neighborhood) could lead to skewed results.\n",

        "A) Concept of Skewness\n",
        "Skewness refers to the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in the distribution of data. It measures how much the shape of a dataset deviates from a perfectly symmetrical bell curve (normal distribution).\n",
        "\n",
        "Symmetrical Distribution: If a dataset is symmetrical, it has a skewness of 0. Both sides of the mean are mirror images.\n",

        "\n",
        "The right tail (larger values) is longer than the left tail.\n",

        "Example:\n",
        "Income distribution often exhibits positive skewness since a small number of individuals earn significantly higher incomes than the majority.\n",

        "Negative Skewness (Left-Skewed):\n",

        "\n",
        "In a skewed distribution, the mean, median, and mode differ.\n",

        "Decision Making:\n",

        "Statistical Analysis:\n",
        "\n",
        "Many statistical methods (e.g., regression, t-tests) assume normality. High skewness violates this assumption and may require data transformations or robust methods.\n",
